# Executive summary

The tenXplore package includes prototypical code to facilitate
the coding of an ontology-driven visualizer of transcriptomic
patterns in single-cell RNA-seq studies.

# Introduction

This package is intended to illustrate the role of formal
ontology in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq experiments.

We anticipate that both unsupervised and supervised methods
of statistical learning
will be useful.  

- The [10x 1.3 million neuron dataset](https://community.10xgenomics.com/t5/10x-Blog/Our-1-3-million-single-cell-dataset-is-ready-to-download/ba-p/276) primarily
invites unsupervised analysis, as no anatomical or other
structural details are provided along with single-cell expression
measures.  
- Other studies that include details on anatomic source
or other non-transcriptomic features of cellular identity
would be amenable to supervised analysis, which will
benefit from standardization of metadata about experimental
factors and anatomic structures.

## A challenge: finding expression signatures of anatomic structures or cell types

Gene Ontology and Gene Ontology Annotation are the primary
resources at present for enumerating gene signatures for
cell types.  The `r Biocpkg("ontoProc")` package
assists in providing some mappings, but much work is needed.

```{r doont}
library(ontoProc)
data(allGOterms)
cellTypeToGO("serotonergic neuron", gotab=allGOterms)
cellTypeToGenes("serotonergic neuron", gotab=allGOterms, orgDb=org.Mm.eg.db)
cellTypeToGenes("serotonergic neuron", gotab=allGOterms, orgDb=org.Hs.eg.db)
```

## Discrimination of neuron types: exploratory multivariate analysis

At this point the API for selecting cell types, bridging to gene
sets, and acquiring expression data, is not well-modularized.  Thus
the best ways to get a feel for it are to use tenXplore() function,
and to read the source code.  In brief, we often fail to find
GO terms that approximately match, as strings, Cell Ontology
terms corresponding to cell subtypes.  On the other hand, if we
match on cell types, we get very large numbers of matches, which
will need to be filtered.  We will introduce tools for generating
additional RDF to improve gene harvesting in real time.  But the
associated statements will need to be curated.
